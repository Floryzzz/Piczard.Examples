Piczard Examples

The aim of those examples is to illustrate the use of the basic features of Piczard - .NET image manipulation library.
These examples may not be drop-in solutions for your application but may help you find the direction you need to solve your particular issue.

The repository contains 2 separate solutions:
- Sharp/CodeCarvings.Piczard.Examples.ExampleSet_A_CS.sln 
- VB.NET/CodeCarvings.Piczard.Examples.ExampleSet_A_VB.sln
Both solutions are absolutely identical with the exception of the used programming language (C # or VB.NET).

The examples have been developed by using version 2008 of Microsoft Visual Studio.
Therefore you must use Microsoft Visual Studio 2008 (or above) in order to properly use the examples.
Visual Studio Express 2012 for Web is available for free here: 
http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/eng/products/visual-studio-express-for-web 

For convenience the examples are contained in an ASP.NET 3.5 website project ("ExampleSet A").
Please note that this does not mean that the Piczard library can only be used in ASP.NET applications.

Moreover the ASP.NET pages make use of Ajax - however - the use of Ajax is not mandatory in order for the proper functioning of Piczard.
